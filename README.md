For Task 2 of my internship, I focused on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a sales dataset. The process involved cleaning the data by handling missing values, eliminating duplicates, and standardizing formats to ensure consistency and accuracy. Once the data was prepared, I performed exploratory analysis to uncover valuable insights, using tools like Excel and Power BI to visualize key metrics such as sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. This task helped me enhance my data cleaning and analytical skills, showcasing the importance of quality data in driving informed decision-making and providing a strong foundation for future analysis and reporting.
